Atmosphere
===============

This section lists the projects that have a primary emphasis on atmospheric science.

ETo
------------
<<<<<<< HEAD
The `ETo <https://github.com/mullenkamp/ETo>`_  project was created to develop programming tools to calculate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using the `UN-FAO 56 paper <http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/X0490E00.htm>`_ [1]. Additional functions have been added to calculate historic ETo or potential evapotranspiration (PET) for comparison purposes. Currently developed for Python.

nasaprecip
----------
The `nasaprecip <https://github.com/mullenkamp/nasaprecip>`_ package contains a class and associated methods/functions to download satellite precipitation data from the TRMM and GPM missions and convert them to `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org>`_ datasets. It uses the python package `pydap <https://pydap.readthedocs.io>`_ to access the OPeNDAP servers with the precipitation data.
