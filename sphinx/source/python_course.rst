Python for Environmental Scientists
=====================================

Hydrosoc 2018 Python/Pandas Fundamentals
-----------------------------------------
The `Hydrosoc 2018 Python workshop <https://hydrosoc-python-2018.readthedocs.io>`_ includes both a basic python course for absolute beginners and a larger section on handling of tabular data and the associated processing and analysis tools. The course primarily uses the toolset contained within the `Pandas package <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/>`_. This includes reading/writing data, indexing, reshaping, computations, joining tables, time series handling, and visualization.

The Environmental Scientist’s Introduction to Python
------------------------------------------------------

`The Environmental Scientist’s Introduction to Python <https://basic-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
is an open source training course to give environmental scientists the foundation they need to begin learning and using
the scientific tools that have been developed for python. The course focuses on simplifying python language into two
buckets: **the must haves** and **the nice to haves**. The course if far from comprehensive, but we believe that it's
better for people to get cracking, and fill in the gaps as they develop their skills.

    **Expected course duration: 1-2 days**
